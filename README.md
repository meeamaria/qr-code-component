## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned not to overcomplicate things. It was first thing I did in frontendmentor.io and I wanted to try to apply more advanced things I had learned. Unfortunately none of them ended up working exactly like I wanted and needed. While I did get some practice with bootstrap and flexbox this piece actually did not need features with them- So I ended up deleteding tons of code and simplifying it and it worked exactly like in design images. Simple versions are sometimes best.

### Continued development

I want to learn to use flexbox and bootstrap more efficiently in the future, even if I ended up using neither in the end result. Also to get more comfortable in general and learn how to figure out best options without having to spend extra time with them.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) - This site has generators and list of basics for HTML, CSS and Javascript. It ended up being useful when I could not remember right thing to round the corners (I remembered word in my native language, but just could not get it in english to my head). Also it helped me with Box Shadow.

## Acknowledgments

I found out about frontendmentor.io only today. I actually really liked this simple challenge there as I had to learn to do things based on design I was given as a image. When following courses they easily give you lot of answers and solutions while giving the design too. Or when trying to make also design yourself, it is easy to fall on things you like and find easy instead of getting practice new things. So I found this site very useful for myself.
